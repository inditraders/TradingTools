	- Integrated GUI with RTDMan - choose active intraday stocks
	- Scrip Manager

DT - Shift-D also causes separate d keystroke. So if Marketwatch has a scrip starting with D, it gets selected
	check how to avoid it.  Datatable opens correctly though, so no bug
Index - x,y click may fail if index list has  multiple indices and big empty space 
Index - check count after removing useless entries
