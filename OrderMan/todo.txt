Save to log csv after trade closed - Will need to input actual expense later - Add some interface for it too


















































	

Target Orders - Allow stop orders for partial exit
OM - 1 click FT B/S
    - Use H/L as stop and LTP as limit entry + some slippage
    - Take H/L and LTP from Marketwatch + take current symbol from AB
Bug
    - Update Target sometimes updates stop instead with bad qty    
    - trackerCallback() -> this.target.isPartiallyFilled()  commented        
        update flow conflicts with tracker thread ? 
GUI calls from trade with GUI in different context can overwrite current context
    // Look if any calls left
    // for all, check how loadTradeToContext() loads data 
Order - Verify all fields after setting and before submit
    Maybe also verify after order creation
Current Status (Partial/Stop X) after Add ? What should it show ?

AB + IB 
    - commit to different git project
    - AB has IBcontroller integrated. 
        - Can call IB through its simple interface including bracket orders
        - partial target
            - Bracket order & OCO does not directly support it
            - Can add multiple stop orders with target-bracketed and standalone parts but it will increase brokerage
            - Workaround is to use **scale entry** for Target order
                - When initial part gets filled, stop size reduces accordingly
                - If no target active then keep the pending Target size far away
                - For T2, Modify existing target order
                    - Set starting price as Target 2 price
                    - Set large increment again for dummy target (trailing position)
                    - set Initial  component size = T1(filled) + T2
                    - set Subsequent Component size to Total size - Initial Component size
                - Do not cancel Target order as it has OCA with Stop order and could not delete OCA group from gui
            - Also check Presets in File > Global configuration
            - api seems to be there but maybe not in AB IB Controller
                https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/classIBApi_1_1Order.html#gsc.tab=0
            - IB controller is open source
                http://www.amibroker.com/devlog/2013/06/03/ibcontroller-1-3-8-source-codes-released/
        - Can test with demo acocunt / paper account
        - Integrate with AB price pickup afl 
            - Add some gui to show prices and to change manually as before        
            - 1 click orders for FT using HOD/LOD as stop and LTP as entry price 
    - AB afl to draw order lines via gfx + link with OM
    - 1 click orders for FT using HOD/LOD as stop + separate default FT target order size    
    - Draw lines via gfx for buy/sell and trigger into IB calls
        - Have some handle area over line and mouse even to capture price update
            See http://www.amibroker.org/userkb/category/afl-programming/gfx-programming/
            "Moving Low Level Graphics (GFX) Objects on your Charts"
        - Need to translate gfx x,y to price
            See http://www.amibroker.org/userkb/category/afl-programming/gfx-programming/
            Finding Pixel Boundaries : 
                see Status("pxchartleft") etc. can get width height
                Status( "lastvisiblebar" )      to get no of bars within the chart
                Status( "firstvisiblebar" );
                Status( "axisminy" )            to get price range
                Status( "axismaxy" )
            Using a GFX Include file : Price to pixel, inverse it  
    ---------- 
    Log to sqlilte Db
        Save everything in sqlite DB, can be used as Trade log
        Also use it load orders on restart
        Maybe through AB plugin, so can directly call from afl
        Also check how to export trades from IB
        Replace TradeLog + stats + slippage etc
            More stats
                Grimes - page 254, 388
                Max Drawdown, Highest  win / loss streaks
                Average drawdown size, hit rate, Sharpe ratio, average daily P/L volatility, etc
    Logging
    Handle Multiple trades
    Current Price vs order Validations  // ex buy stop should be above current price etc
    Reconcile with contract notes + expenses    
    check - Import from gmail 
        can forward contract notes to dummy email address 
        read from inbox and move to folder
        save all contract logs
